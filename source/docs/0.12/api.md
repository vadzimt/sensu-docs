# The Sensu API {#the-sensu-api}

The Sensu API provides access to the data Sensu servers collect, such as clients & events.

The API is capable of requesting checks be executed and can resolve events.

When using the Sensu packages, you may start the API on one or more boxes with `/etc/init.d/sensu-api start`.  Logs for the api are located at `/var/log/sensu/sensu-api.log`.

## Configuration {#configuration}

The sensu-api is generally configured in the `/etc/sensu/config.json`; refer to [installing sensu](guide) for more information.  The available options for the api configuration are as follows:

~~~ json

    "port": 4567,
